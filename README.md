# üìå Introduction

Welcome to the **Git Assessment Project**! This project is designed to teach you about Git workflows, using GitHub for collaboration, and handling merge conflicts. As a part of this project, you'll practice using **feature branches, creating pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts**. The skills you gain here will help you become proficient in **version control** and **collaborative software development**.

This repository contains pre-configured conflicts and instructions to simulate a real-world collaborative development environment.

## üìã Project Overview

The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with the following key concepts:

1. **Version Control**: Understanding how to manage project code using Git.
2. **Branching Strategies**: Creating and managing branches effectively using Git Flow.
3. **Pull Requests**: Submitting and reviewing changes in GitHub through pull requests.
4. **Merge Conflicts**: Resolving conflicts when multiple developers modify the same file.

By the end of the project, you should be able to:

- Create and manage branches in Git.
- Use GitHub pull requests for collaboration.
- Resolve merge conflicts manually.
- Follow the Git flow process in a team environment.
